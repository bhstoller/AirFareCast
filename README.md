We aim to use time series forecasting and machine learning to predict variations in airline ticket prices leading up to departure. The airline industry is a notorious case study of the price elasticity of demand, with nearly all modern airlines utilizing dynamic pricing strategies to adjust ticket prices based on factors such as time to departure, demand, and other market conditions.

Our hypothesis is that by modeling how prices change based on time to departure, it is possible to predict when ticket prices are most likely to increase. Specifically, we aim to analyze historical flight price data to identify temporal patterns that will allow us to better understand the fluctuations in price leading up to a flightâ€™s departure. This would ultimately help consumers make more informed decisions, increasing confidence in their planning and minimizing unnecessary spending.
